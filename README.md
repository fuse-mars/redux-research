# Redux Research

Exploring different ways of using redux
## Typescript 1

## Typescript 2

```sh
# found in folder ./typescript-2
```

So far my favorite implementation because you can define 
* State as an **interface** so that you do not end up `accessing piece of data that is not part of your state`
* Action types as **enum**, that way you don't have to write `error prone strings` in your action creators

## Immutable-js

```sh
# found in folder ./immutable-js

An interesting idea from my co-worker, that relies on the power of **Immutable-js** to get rid of **switch statements** that exists in every **reducer**
